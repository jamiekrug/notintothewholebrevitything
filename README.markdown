This repo will serve as a home for my demo app for my [End-to-End CFML App Design](http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/sessions/end-to-end-application-design-featuring-coldspringaop-fw1-mxunit-orm-and-validatethis/) presentation at [cf.Objective()](http://www.cfobjective.com/) in May 2011. The goal of the session will be good, maintainable object-oriented CFML application design, primarily featuring the following tool set: [ColdSpring](http://sourceforge.net/projects/coldspring/), [Framework One (FW/1)](https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1), [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org/), [ValidateThis](http://www.validatethis.org/) and [ColdFusion ORM](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSD628ADC4-A5F7-4079-99E0-FD725BE9B4BD.html).

I plan to keep a number of different branches for this demo app, ranging from something like a fairly simple prototype to the full-fledged demo app with all tools and frameworks included, with everything in between (in essence, starting simple and building up, adding one tool at a time). That is to say that these branches are intended for demonstration purposes, and not necessarily a fully polished application (certainly none of the simplified branches).

I will likely use the resulting application as a starting point for a fun "little" site of mine, [notintothewholebrevitything.com](http://notintothewholebrevitything.com/) ;-)
