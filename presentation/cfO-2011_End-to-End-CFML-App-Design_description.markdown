End-to-End Application Design; Featuring ColdSpring/AOP, FW/1, MXUnit, ORM and ValidateThis
===========================================================================================

The goal of this session is to walk through the design and development process of a well-designed real world application, while exploring some great frameworks and application design patterns. While it is important to learn the details of each tool chosen to help build a given application, it is also important to understand how these tools integrate and work together, as each has its own benefits and addresses specific problem areas. We will learn first-hand how these tools may work together to efficiently develop a high quality, maintainable CFML application. We will not take a deep dive into all features of each framework, but a brief introduction to each will be provided. Throughout this session we will walk through the development and re-factoring of a sample application, as we learn to apply each framework and concept. With some important application design and analysis concepts, along with the power of code re-factoring, we can gain the confidence to get coding productively, and to avoid design paralysis.
